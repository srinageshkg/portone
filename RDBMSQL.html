  ACID
  <ul>
  <li>Atomicity:transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work
    Atomicity is often achieved using techniques like transaction logs and write-ahead logs</li>
  <li>Consistency: guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another consistent state  </li>
  <li>Isolation:prevents interference or data corruption when multiple transactions are executed concurrently  </li>
  <li>Durability: guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes to the database are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures  </li>
</ul>

First Normal Form:: single-valued attribute
Second Normal Form: no partial dependency: it has no non-prime attribute that depends on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table
Third Normal Form: no transitive dependency: all non-prime attributes are determined only by the candidate keys of the relation and not by any other non-prime attribute
Boyce-Codd Normal Form: every functional dependency, Left-Hand-Side is super key.
