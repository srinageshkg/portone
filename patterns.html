    <li>Creational Design Patterns<br>
    <b>Factory Method. Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.</b><br>
    <b>Abstract Factory. provides a way to create families of related objects without imposing their concrete classes, by encapsulating a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.</b><br>
    <b>Builder. Uses to create complex objects.Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.</b><br>
    Prototype. Creates a new object from an existing object.when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.<br>
    <b>Singleton. Ensures only one instance of an object is created.restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance.</b><br>
    <br><li>Structural Design Patterns<br>
    Adapter. Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.<br>
    Bridge. Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.<br>
    Composite. Takes a group of objects into a single object.<br>
    <b>Decorator. Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time. allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.</b><br>
    Facade. Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.<br>
    Flyweight. Reduces the cost of complex object models.<br>
    Proxy. Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.<br>
    <br><li>Behavior Design Patterns<br>
    Chain of Responsibility. Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.<br>
    <b>Command. Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.</b><br>
    Interpreter. Implements a specialized language.<br>
    Iterator. Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.<br>
    Mediator. Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.<br>
    Memento. Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.<br>
    <b>Observer. Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.</b><br>
    State. Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.<br>
    <b>Strategy. Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.</b><br>
    Template Method. Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.<br>
    Visitor. Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.<br>

    <b>J2EE patterns:</b><br>

    MVC Pattern<br>
    Data Access Object pattern<br>
    Front controller pattern<br>
    Intercepting filter pattern<br>
    Transfer object pattern<br>
